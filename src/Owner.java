/**I made a giveRaise method that takes in the class and feed it a percentageRaise argument
 The signature looks like this
 void giveRaise(Class<?> className , double percentRaise)
 from there we used an enhanced for loop of the dataType object (Employee in my case) and had it take items out of the arraylist and assign them to an employee variable.
 then i created an if statement that verifys a match (==) between my employee.getClass() and the className*/
